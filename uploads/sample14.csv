There are some amazing stories here:
"A trader who, after wiping out several times early in his career, turned a $30,000 account into $80"
million A fund manager who achieved what many thought impossible—five consecutive years of
triple-digit percentage returns A trader from small-town America who started out on a shoestring
"and has become one of the world's largest bond traders A former securities analyst who, during the"
"past seven years, has realized an average monthly return of 25 percent (over 1,400 percent"
"armualized), primarily trading stock index futures An electrical engineering graduate from МГГ"
"whose largely computerized approach to trading has earned his accounts an astounding 250,000"
percent return over a sixteen-year period.
"These are but a sampling of the interviews contained in this book. In his own way, each of the"
traders interviewed has achieved incredible success.
What sets these traders apart? Most people think that winning in the markets has something to do
with finding the secret formula. The truth is that any common denominator among the traders I
interviewed had more to do with attitude than approach. Some of the traders use fundamental
"analysis exclusively, others employ only technical analysis, and still others combine the two. Some"
"traders operate on a time horizon measured in hours or even minutes, while others typically"
implement positions that they intend to hold for months or even years. Although the trading
"methodologies varied widely, the forthcoming interviews reveal certain important commonalities in"
trading attitudes and principles.
Trading provides one of the last great frontiers of opportunity in our economy. It is one of the very
few ways in which an individual can start with a relatively small bankroll and actually become a
"multimillionaire. Of course, only a handful of individuals (such as those interviewed here) succeed"
"in turning this feat, but at least the opportunity exists."
While I hardly expect all readers of this book to transform themselves into super-traders—the
world just doesn't work that way—I believe that these thought-provoking interviews will help most
serious and open-minded readers improve their personal trading performance. It may even help a
select few become super-traders.
